# Arbron's Compendium Tools

The best way to share content between worlds in Foundry VTT is to create a module to hold your compendium packs. Unfortunately the process of creating these modules and updating them with new content leaves much to be desired. This module provides several tools that should improve the process of creating and updating compendium modules.

## Tools
- **Compendium Edit Permissions**: Setting to allow users of the Player or Trusted level to modify the contents of a Compendium. *Note*: Changes will only be applied if a GM is logged in at the same time as the changes are made.
- **Replace Entry**: Replace compendium entries with a saved item while retaining the item's ID. This will prevent breaking of links between items in the compendium.
- **View Module Manifest**: View the complete manifest information for any installed module. Access this information by going to the Manage Modules screen in Game Settings, right clicking on the module you would like to view, and selecting View Manifest.
