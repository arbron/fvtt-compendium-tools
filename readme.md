# Compendium Tools

Various tools to help with authoring compendium modules.

## Tools
- **Bypass Edit Lock**: Setting to allow for editing of locked Compendia including those that belong to a loaded module while still respecting permissions requirements.
- **Replace Entry**: Replace compendium entries with a saved item while retaining the item's ID. This will prevent breaking of links between items in the compendium.


## Developer Tools
- **ctGetCompendiumItemContext**: New Hook called when the context menus for Compendium entries are generated to allow module developers to add their own context menu items.
